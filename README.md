# roll20api
A collection of scripts used in Roll20 modules.  The **modules** folder contains
scripts that are one-offs for particular modules.  When paired with the actual game, they will
allow the GM to run the tabletop puzzles in a Roll20 setting.

Other folders would contain more general purpose Roll20 api scripts, either extracted from
module locations or written from the ground up for script inclusions.
